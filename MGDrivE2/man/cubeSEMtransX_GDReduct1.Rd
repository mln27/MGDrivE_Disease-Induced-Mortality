\description{
This is the second ReMEDE system put forth by \href{GETLINKWHENEXISTS!!!}{Chennuri and Myles}.
It's another realization of \href{https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0804}{biodegradable gene drives},
where the pieces exist as independently-recombining constructs that only act
when in the presence of each other.
}
\details{
This construct consists of one X-linked target site and one autosomal target site.
The first site, on the X chromosome, carries
gRNA and Cas9 for homing and removal of the SEM site. The second site, on
an autosome, consists of an endonuclease targeting the Cas9 site. Both sites
contain direct repeats to induce SSA upon chromosome damage. This version has
been completely reduced, removing all resistance alleles. There are 4 possible alleles at the first site:
\itemize{
 \item X: Wild-type X allele
 \item G: Active GD (gene drive), with targetable SEM (self-elimination mechanism) site
 \item V: "wild-type", product of SEM, non-targetable by GD or SEM
 \item Y: Y-chromosome, non-targetable
}

There are 3 possible alleles at the autosomal second site:
\itemize{
 \item W: Wild-type allele
 \item H: Active SEM element
 \item E: "wild-type", produce of GD, non-targetbale by GD
}

This provides a total genotype count of 54 in the cube, however, only 36 viable
female genotypes and 18 viable male genotypes. Genotypes are written (site 1)(site 1)(site 2)(site 2),
where "site 1" is X-linked and "site 2" is autosomally linked.
Therefore, a genotype of XXHE would be female and completely wild-type at the first locus,
and at the second locus a compound heterozygote with the SEM allele and a
non-targetable wild-type equivalent allele.

"V" and "E" alleles are simply minor alleles with the same protein sequence as the
major allele at their respective loci, "W" or "X". There is the possibility for allelic
conversion of the "V" allele into the "X" allele by mechanisms such as MMR.

This drive has male and female specific GD and SEM parameters, as well as
maternal deposition for both SEM and GD elements. There are no dosage effects
modeled (i.e., having two GD alleles increasing or decreasing the GD rates).

Gene-drive and SEM parameters (p*, a*, c*, x*, mmr*) are
all rates and values must fall in the range of [0, 1], inclusive.

Population parameters (phi, xiF, xiM) are either NULL, for default values, or
named vectors, where the names must match the names in the inheritance pattern.
These parameters are also rates and fall in the range of [0, 1], inclusive.

Omega and s may also be NULL or named vectors, but are weights, and thus fall
in the range [0, inf).

Eta, the male mating weights, may be NULL for default values, or applied as a
list of vectors. If the vectors are length 2 (e.g., c(maleGeno, matingWeight)),
then that weight is applied to all female genotypes for that specific male genotype.
Alternatively, vectors of length 3 may be supplied (e.g., c(femaleGeno, maleGeno, matingWeight)).
In this case, the mating weight only applies to the specific female X male mating
event. The two lists may NOT be mixed - the list must hold all length 2 or all
length 3 vectors.
