\title{MGDrivE2: Inheritance Cube}
\description{
To model an arbitrary number of genotypes efficiently in the same mathematical
framework, we use a 3-dimensional array structure (cube) where each axis
represents the following information:
 * x: female adult mate genotype
* y: male adult mate genotype
* z: proportion of the offspring that inherits a given genotype (layer)
}
\details{
The cube structure gives us the flexibility to apply tensor operations to the
elements within our equations, so that we can calculate the stratified population
dynamics rapidly; and within a readable, flexible computational framework.
This becomes apparent when we define the equation we use for the computation
of eggs laid at any given point in time:

\deqn{\overline{O(T_x)} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \Bigg( \bigg( (\beta*\overline{s} * \overline{ \overline{Af_{[t-T_x]}}}) * \overline{\overline{\overline{Ih}}} \bigg) * \Lambda  \Bigg)^{\top}_{ij}}

In this equation, the matrix containing the number of mated adult females
(\eqn{\overline{\overline{Af}}}) is multiplied element-wise with each one of
the layers containing the eggs genotypes proportions expected from this cross
(\eqn{\overline{\overline{\overline{Ih}}}}). The resulting matrix is then
multiplied by a binary 'viability mask' (\eqn{\Lambda}) that filters out
female-parent to offspring genetic combinations that are not viable due to
biological impediments (such as cytoplasmic incompatibility). The summation of
the transposed resulting matrix returns us the total fraction of eggs resulting
from all the male to female genotype crosses (\eqn{\overline{O(T_x)}}).

Note: For inheritance operations to be consistent within the framework the
summation of each element in the z-axis (this is, the proportions of each one
of the offspring's genotypes) must be equal to one.

Note Note: This documentation was shamelessly stolen from MGDrivE in order
to support novel cubes implemented in this package.

\section{Drive-specific Cubes}{


An inheritance cube in an array object that specifies inheritance probabilities
(offspring genotype probability) stratified by male and female parent genotypes.
MGDrivE provides the following cubes to model different gene drive systems:
 * \code{\link{cubeSEM}}: Single-locus, autosomal construct implementing a self-elimination mechanism
 * \code{\link{cubeSEMX}}: Single-locus, X-linked construct implementing a self-elimination mechanism
}

\section{Functions for Cubes}{


We provide one auxiliary function to operate on cube objects.
 * \code{\link{cube2csv}}: Export slices of a cube to .csv format
}
