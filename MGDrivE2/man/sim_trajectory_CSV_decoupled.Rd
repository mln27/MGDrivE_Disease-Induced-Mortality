\description{
This function provides a unified interface to the various decoupled simulation algorithms
for SPN, returning output sampled at a lattice of time points to the user, and
handling various exogenous events that may occur during the simulation
(such as release of adult mosquitoes). This function is used in decoupled sampling, where
the mosquito and human states are separated. This is used \strong{only} when using the
Imperial model of malaria transmission.
}
\details{
\code{dt_stoch} is used by the Poisson Time-Step (\code{\link{step_PTS_decoupled}})
method to approximate the hazards.
A smaller \code{dt_stoch} provides a better approximation, but will take longer
to run.

The stoichiometry matrix (\code{S}) is generated in \code{\link{spn_S}}.

The list of hazards (\code{hazards}) come from \code{\link{spn_hazards}}.

Two samplers are provided. The default is a Poisson Time-Step
(\code{\link{step_PTS_decoupled}}) method.
Additionally, for convenience, an ODE "sampler" (\code{\link{step_ODE_decoupled}}) is
provided for compatibility with other samplers. This function uses methods from
\code{deSolve}.

If using the \code{ode} sampler, several \code{methods} are provided in the \code{deSolve}
package, see \code{\link[deSolve]{ode}}. For inhomogeneous systems, consider
using the "rk4" method to avoid excessive integration times.

Additionally, \code{events} objects may be used for "releases", and must follow
the format required by \code{deSolve}. This means that events must be a \code{data.frame}
with four columns - \code{var}, \code{time}, \code{value}, and \code{method} -
in any order and \code{stringsAsFactors = FALSE}. \code{Events} currently must be one of two types:
\itemize{
 \item: 'add': When the \code{method} is \code{add}, this represents a classic
        release scenario. Appropriate values from the \code{value} column are
        added to the state defined in the \code{var} column at the appropriate
        moments as defined in the \code{time} column.
 \item: 'swap': The \code{swap} method is similar to a small-molecule spray, where
        a chemical is applied to the landscape and "turns-on" or "turns-off"
        genotypes. This functionality uses the states defined in the \code{value}
        column to move the counts within those states to states defined in the
        \code{var} column. Then, the state specified in the \code{value} column
        is set to \code{0}, effectively "swapping" \code{value} into \code{var}.
        Again, these events occur as specified in the \code{time} column.
}

This function writes all output to .csv files. Each simulation is written to
a \code{folder} element - the number of repetitions is the number of folders
provided. For now, only adult mosquito states, human states, clinical incidence, and pathogen prevalence are
written to CSVs.

This function tracks state variables specified by argument \code{stage} by default; an optional argument \code{Sout}
can be provided to track number of event firings each time step (for discrete stochastic simulations),
or cumulative intensity (for continuous stochastic simulations), or the rate function of
particular events for ODE simulation. The matrix must have number of columns equal to
number of events in the system (the number of hazard functions), and a row for each tracking
variable. If \code{Sout} is provided, it outputs an additional csv, "Tracking.csv".
The function \code{\link{track_hinf}} is provided, which builds a matrix to track
human infection events.
