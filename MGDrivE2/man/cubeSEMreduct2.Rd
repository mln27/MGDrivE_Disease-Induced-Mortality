\description{
The ReMEDE system, put forth by \href{GETLINKWHENEXISTS!!!}{Chennuri and Myles},
is a realized application of \href{https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0804}{biodegradable gene drives}
with application of \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107841}{Small-Molecule Control}
for the removal of drive elements through induceable SSA.
}
\details{
This construct has a single, autosomal target site that carries gRNA, Cas9,
an induceable endonuclease, and is flanked by direct repeats. This version has
been slightly reduced, removing the regular resistance alleles, but keeping the
one resistance allele associated with SEM. Therefore, there are 5 possible alleles:
\itemize{
 \item W: Wild-type
 \item G: Active GD (gene drive), with inactive but functional SEM (self-elimination mechanism) element
 \item V: "wild-type", product of SEM, non-targetable by GD or SEM
 \item H: Active GD with active SEM
 \item S: Active GD with non-functional SEM
}

"V" alleles are simply a minor allele with the same protein sequence as the
major allele, "W". There is the possibility for allelic conversion of the "V"
allele into the "W" allele by mechanisms such as MMR.

This drive has male and female specific GD and SEM parameters, but here are no dosage effects
modeled (i.e., having two GD alleles increasing or decreasing the GD rates).
Proper  maternal deposition is modeled, but with no resistance alleles possible.
